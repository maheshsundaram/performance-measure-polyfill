[Before Chrome 78](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/measure#browser_compatibility), `performance.measure` did not return [`PerformanceMeasure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceMeasure). This polyfills that cabability according to the [User Timing](https://w3c.github.io/user-timing/#dom-performance-measure) spec and borrowing some from [Deno's performance web extension](https://deno.land/x/deno@v1.38.0/ext/web/15_performance.js?source=).
